1. Setup the project 
 <!-- Guide to setup Prisma locally  -->
	https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart

2. Model 
 <!-- see file -Prisma/schema.prisma -->
	this is a single file where you have all of your schema 
	schema -> basically what your db looks like. when you are using sql your schema should be well defined 
	In case of prisma  rather than running the create table command it says jsut tell me your schema upfront 
	in a specific format and then It will automatically give you the migration file and you can run it 

3. Major three Steps 
 <!-- see the image -->
	../ORMs_Prisma/ThreeSteps.png
	this files is the schema for the model to prisma and with the help of this file prisma will auto generate all the files for you which we just have to run and thats it . I as a developer just have to define the schema properly

 <!-- Model Specifications -->
	read about the @id @relations @default etc 

4. After setting up the schema Perform the migration step 
	<!-- for this command to run you should have a postgres locally   -->
	<!-- Or -->
	<!-- You can go to neon.tech and get a full acces to a postgres database for free and paste the url here -->
	npx prisma migrate dev --name init
	What this will do ?
		1. there will be a new folder created in the project named -> migrations
		2. there will be a file named migration.sql which will contain 
			all the sql queries automatically generated accourding to your model specifications
