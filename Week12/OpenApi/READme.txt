Problem :-
If in a product there are many end points in the backend and the company needs to change the name of an end point
then the frontend also needs to change accordingly hence then this is at times difficult to document .
This problem is solved by GraphQL , trpc , OpenApi etc 

More standard way for frontend to communicate to backend, they at a highlevel create some files that have a specification,
and looking at a file you can figureout that this end point is hitting to this end point etc.

Usefull where : -
	Important 
		for example if you want to make a plugin for chatGPT of your web servise then, for chatGPT to hit your correct backend 
		you need to make a OpenApi file that is a standard file for communication
