docker version
docker images 					All images on the machine
docker ps  						All containers running on your machine ( will show many containers with their ids)

 for debugging 
docker exec -it <Container_Id> /bin/bash   
	this command takes you in side the container file ( it is similar to sshing into the machine )

docker kill <container_id>
