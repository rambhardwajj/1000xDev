What is monorepo?
	A monorepo, short for "monolithic repository," is a software development approach 
	where multiple projects or software components are stored within a single version control 
	repository (such as Git or Mercurial) instead of using separate repositories for each project
	or component. In a monorepo, all the code and related assets for an organization or a specific 
	part of a software ecosystem are stored together.
